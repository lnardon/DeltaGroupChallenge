# Delta Group Challenge

The Coding Challenge given to me was to recreate an Adobe Xd Mobile Screen with mocked information using a Vanilla Stack (HTML, CSS and JS) and also in React.
As a plus to the challenge, I decided to implement a functional map and coordinates system instead of using a mocked image as the map.
